# **Reporting Security Issues**

The project's team and community take security issues.

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it using Github's [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Alternatively, contact the maintainers directly.

We'll endeavour to respond quickly and keep you updated throughout the process.
